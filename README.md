![Gapminder Vizabi 0.4](http://static.gapminder.org/vizabi/vizabi.jpg)

Welcome to the vizabi repository! 

(Please note that current version of Vizabi is still a work in progress, and Vizabi 1.0.0 will be the public release of the framework). [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Gapminder/vizabi.png?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/Gapminder/vizabi)


####What is Vizabi?
Gapminder Vizabi is our framework for developing data visualizations supporting mobile devices, responsiveness, localization, embedding support and unified data schema. You can use Vizabi to create a new visualization based on your data or modify our set of vizualization tools.  

####Can I see it in action?
Yes. See our example pages here: [Vizabi Examples](http://static.gapminder.org/vizabi-recent/preview_pages/). If you want to check out even more examples, check our [Vizabi Examples Repo](https://github.com/Gapminder/vizabi-examples).

#### Where can I find full documentation?
See our WIKI for detailed documentation: [Vizabi WIKI](https://github.com/Gapminder/vizabi/wiki/)

### QuickStart

*Note*: You can watch the screencast on [How to Get Started with Vizabi] (http://vimeo.com/107568568). 

####Cloning
In order to run vizabi locally, clone it:

```sh
git clone http://github.com/Gapminder/vizabi
cd vizabi
```

####Dependencies
Vizabi depends on [Npm](https://github.com/npm/npm), [Bower](https://github.com/bower/bower) and [Grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt). 

**Npm** is a package manager for [Nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) and therefore requires [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) to be installed. Here is a tutorial to install Node: [Installing Node.js via Package Managers](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager). 

**Bower** is a package manager and you can install it with npm:
```sh
$ sudo npm install -g bower
```

**Grunt** is the Javascript task runner and can also be installed with npm:
```sh
$ sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
```

**Ruby and Ruby Gems** are needed for building Vizabi. Here you can find tutorial to install *Ruby* and *Rubygems*:

* [Install Ruby] (https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/installation/)
* [Install Rubygems] (https://rubygems.org/pages/download)

**SASS**

```sh
sudo gem install sass
```

Now that you have all Vizabi's dependencies in place, you can install Vizabi.



####Installing
Go to Vizabi directory and run the following commands in the terminal:

```sh
npm install
bower install
```


*Note*: You may need to run ```npm install``` with *sudo*.

####Running and Developing
We use grunt to build Vizabi. You can run Vizabi for Development or Production: ```grunt [dev|build]```.

In order to run the project in development mode, type the following:
```sh
grunt dev
```
With this, Grunt will automatically start a local server and open the example pages in your browser at [http://localhost:9000/](http://localhost:9000/). You can see the list of data visualization examples . Vizabi support Grunt tasks such as ```watch```, ```copy``` to ease development in this mode.

In order to build the project, type the following:
```sh
grunt build
```

You can find the build output under ```dist/```.


### Contribution
 The following list provides some parts that Vizabi will benefit from your contribution:
 * Unit Testing: Write Unit Tests for Vizabi. The priority is with base classes, of course.
 * Tools & Components: Create More tools for Vizabi. [D3js](www.d3js.org) gallery has inspiring examples: [https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery](D3 Gallery)
 * Styles: Contribute to Vizabi by enhancing the user experience.
